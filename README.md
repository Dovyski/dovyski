## Hey there! 👋

![fernando-coding-hue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/512405/151720112-d9ef168d-6526-4eda-a13f-707ad53ddaab.gif)

My name is **Fernando Bevilacqua**, I am software developer currently living in Brazil 🇧🇷. I like to code and create new things, specially when they can help me or anyone somehow. I spend a lot of my (free) time coding, for my own and for other open-source projects.

### ⚒️ Work

I have hands-on experience on a variety of technologies and software projects, including game development, enterprise application development, and finally research/teaching work related to human-computer interaction, computer graphics and programming. I've been a team member, team leader and also project manager.

### 🎓 Education

I have a BSc degree in Computer Science, a masters in Computation (focused on Computer Graphics) and a PhD in Informatics (focused on Human-Computer Interaction).

### ✨ Cool stuff about me

- 🕹️ Co-founded a game development company and shipped a bunch of games (PC and web).
- 📚 I've been a lecturer of Computer Science for several years.
- 📡 I've been a consultant for companies working with healthtech, AI/speech, games and education.
- ⚡ Built my own code editor ([Codebot](https://github.com/Dovyski/Codebot)), then made it a web-based editor.
- 🔭 I wrote a [few scientific papers](https://www.fernandobevilacqua.com/academic/publications/) about emotions, games and computers.
- 🧐 Published a [software/method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoN8JuRZbwk) for detecting stress and boredom of players based on heart rate and facial actions (all done remotely, no sensors).
- 💬 I like to teach and write tutorials ([already wrote](https://tutsplus.com/authors/fernando-bevilacqua) about many topics related to gamedev).
- 🙌 The tutorial series [Understanding Steering Behaviors](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/series/understanding-steering-behaviors--gamedev-12732) that I authored is top 1 result on Google regarding steering behaviors. It has also been praised by Craig W. Reynolds, the original invetor of the technique (🤯).
- 😅 Built a software ([Besearcher](https://github.com/Dovyski/Besearcher)) to run my experiments and e-mail me when anything interesting pops-up, so I could have more time for coffee.
- 💚 I've been involved with open source for quite a while. I've been a co-maintainer (of [Flixel Community](https://github.com/flixelcommunity), a game engine), main maintainer (of [cvui](https://github.com/Dovyski/cvui), a C++/python ui lib for OpenCV) and contributor ([Haxeflixel](https://github.com/haxeflixel) and [Flixel Studio](https://github.com/Dovyski/flixel-studio), for instance).
